# Workday-Independent-Contractor-Approval

While at Nordstrom, I identified a gap critical to our hiring process as we transitioned from one applicant tracking system to another (Workday). In filling this gap, I worked closely with the development team and technology PMO (Project Management Office) to create a fast-follow solution for approving Independent Contractor requests internally. This involved bringing the vendor, leadership, key stakeholders, the engineering team, marketing, recruiting, legal, and other contributors to the table to find a solution that would work for all. 

In the end we implemented a solution that resolved the business concern as well as satisfied all stakeholders.
