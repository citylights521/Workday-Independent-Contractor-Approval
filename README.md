# Workday-Independent-Contractor-Approval

At Nordstrom I worked closely with the development team and technology PMO (Project Management Office) to create a fast-follow solution for approving Independent Contractor requests internally. This took place as we migrated from an Oracle ATS (Applicant Tracking System) to the Workday ATS. Due to this being sensitive information for Nordstrom, I am not at liberty to share the details of this project, but can share that the system we had in place in Oracle was no longer viable once we were live in Workday.

The solution that was put into place was a mid-term solution that regulated the approval process systematically with the involvement of the Contingent Workforce Team in the form of approval audits. This solution was meant to be in effect for 1-2 years during the RFP (Request for Proposal) for the Contingent Workforce Team to find a third party IC service; a task that was already underway at the time.
